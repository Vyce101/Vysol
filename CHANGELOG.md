# Changelog

All notable user-visible changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Initial GraphRAG backend and frontend with a resilient local launcher.
- Split setup and usage docs into dedicated guides for setup, walkthrough, and features.
- Added a dedicated system diagram page and linked it from the README.
- Added branding assets and a README logo.
- Added entity resolution run modes, including `Exact only` and `Exact + chooser/combiner`.
- Added per-key Gemini API key toggles and a dedicated repo-local pytest temp folder.
- Added the VySol browser/header branding icon using the square logo asset.
- Added a per-message `Context Graph` view in Context X-Ray for newer chat messages.
- Added a Safety Review Queue for extraction safety blocks, including one-shot recovery for already-collapsed blocked chunks and in-app chunk editing/testing.
- Added inline chat renaming in the sidebar, with conflict-safe saves that preserve Recent ordering.

### Changed

- Refreshed docs and aligned runtime defaults.
- Corrected project branding capitalization to `VySol`.
- Documented entity resolution run modes.
- Documented API key toggle behavior in the walkthrough and Google AI Studio key guide.
- Renamed the default embedding model to `gemini-embedding-2-preview`.
- Changed retrieval entry-node indexing to use one persistent vector per current graph node, with `Re-embed All` rebuilding from the current saved graph state.
- Changed model-context assembly and Context X-Ray to preserve real graph nodes even when different nodes share the same display name, instead of fake-merging them by label.
- Changed `# RAG Chunks` context assembly to keep full chunk text and `[B#:C#]` provenance tags while ordering included chunks by temporal provenance.
- Changed graph node sizing and force spacing so high-connection nodes scale larger and crowded hubs spread farther apart in the graph viewers.
- Changed ingestion rebuild controls so `Re-embed All` now verifies the original ingested source set, ignores brand-new pending sources, and blocks when older ingested files changed or need a clean rebuild.
- Changed safety-review editing to use one editable `Raw Chunk` field with immutable original text, repeatable test/reset flows, and clearer rebuild guards around repaired chunk overrides.
- Changed graph extraction to use chunk-body text plus separate reference-only overlap context, while keeping prefixed combined chunk text for embeddings, chat provenance, and storage.
- Changed safety-review editing to show overlap separately from the editable chunk body and exposed a dedicated Graph Architect glean prompt in the prompt editor.
- Changed `Re-embed All` to reuse active repaired chunk bodies when the locked ingest snapshot still matches, while full rebuild paths remain blocked until overrides are discarded.
- Changed entity resolution to expose per-run unique-node embedding batch and delay controls in the UI.

### Fixed

- Fixed glean default/input behavior and clarified the currently supported OS.
- Fixed launcher startup state detection.
- Fixed Gemini chat payload assembly for the Gemini SDK request shape.
- Fixed graph node focus visibility by adding a subtle white hover glow and a stronger selected-node glow in both the graph tab and Context Graph viewer.
- Fixed graph edge hover details to show source and target names plus provenance in the graph viewer.
- Fixed graph viewer startup layout so first-open graphs spread correctly and auto-fit no longer hijacks manual navigation.
- Fixed graph node hitboxes, shared graph-viewer modal sizing, context-graph interaction regressions, and uniform edge hover behavior across the graph tab and Context Graph.
- Fixed Context Graph role visibility by explicitly labeling entry nodes versus expanded nodes in the graph legend, tooltips, and inspector.
- Fixed chunk extraction edge binding so newly extracted edges attach to the exact node UUIDs created for that chunk instead of an older same-name node elsewhere in the graph.
- Fixed safety-block retry handling so blocked chunks stay in the safety-review flow, retries do not collapse them into fake extraction success, and stale review popups/testing states recover cleanly.
- Fixed chat thread switching so in-flight replies and history versions stay isolated to the correct chat tab instead of leaking across chats.
- Fixed chat auto-scroll so any upward scroll disables snapping until the user reaches the bottom again.
- Fixed Gemini key rotation so extraction, embeddings, retrieval, and Gemini chat wait through shared cooldown windows, fail over on transient timeout/connect failures, and stop skipping extra keys after some retries.
- Fixed ingest progress so long pauses now surface as queued slot or API-key cooldown waits instead of looking like the run silently froze.

### Removed

- Removed obsolete frontend-local README/test-writing clutter that no longer belonged in the shipped project.
