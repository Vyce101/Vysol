# Changelog

All notable user-visible changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Initial GraphRAG backend and frontend with a resilient local launcher.
- Split setup and usage docs into dedicated guides for setup, walkthrough, and features.
- Added a dedicated system diagram page and linked it from the README.
- Added branding assets and a README logo.
- Added entity resolution run modes, including `Exact only` and `Exact + chooser/combiner`.
- Added per-key Gemini API key toggles and a dedicated repo-local pytest temp folder.
- Added the VySol browser/header branding icon using the square logo asset.
- Added a per-message `Context Graph` view in Context X-Ray for newer chat messages.

### Changed

- Refreshed docs and aligned runtime defaults.
- Corrected project branding capitalization to `VySol`.
- Documented entity resolution run modes.
- Documented API key toggle behavior in the walkthrough and Google AI Studio key guide.
- Renamed the default embedding model to `gemini-embedding-2-preview`.
- Changed retrieval entry-node indexing to use one persistent vector per current graph node, with `Re-embed All` rebuilding from the current saved graph state.
- Changed model-context assembly and Context X-Ray to preserve real graph nodes even when different nodes share the same display name, instead of fake-merging them by label.

### Fixed

- Fixed glean default/input behavior and clarified the currently supported OS.
- Fixed launcher startup state detection.
- Fixed Gemini chat payload assembly for the Gemini SDK request shape.
- Fixed graph edge hover details to show source and target names plus provenance in the graph viewer.
- Fixed graph viewer startup layout so first-open graphs spread correctly and auto-fit no longer hijacks manual navigation.
- Fixed graph node hitboxes, shared graph-viewer modal sizing, context-graph interaction regressions, and uniform edge hover behavior across the graph tab and Context Graph.
- Fixed Context Graph role visibility by explicitly labeling entry nodes versus expanded nodes in the graph legend, tooltips, and inspector.

### Removed

- Removed obsolete frontend-local README/test-writing clutter that no longer belonged in the shipped project.
