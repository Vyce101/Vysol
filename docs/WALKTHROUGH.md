# Walkthrough

## Settings Walkthrough

Open the settings sidebar from the home screen before you ingest your first world.

### API Keys

- Only Gemini API keys are supported in VySol's built-in key management flow
- Click the `+` button to add each key
- Saved keys stay stored in Settings even when you toggle them off
- Only active saved keys participate in key rotation
- If every saved key is inactive, VySol can still fall back to `GEMINI_API_KEY` from your local environment

Key Rotation Mode:

- `Fail Over`: keeps using the current key until it hits a rate limit, then moves to the next one
- `Round Robin`: rotates across keys to spread load more evenly

Per-key toggle behavior:

- `ON` means the key is active and eligible for rotation
- `OFF` means the key stays saved on disk but is skipped by `Fail Over` and `Round Robin`
- The Settings sidebar shows how many keys are active versus how many are stored

Cooldown behavior:

- If all active Gemini keys are temporarily cooling down, VySol can wait and continue when a key becomes available again instead of always failing immediately
- During ingest, this appears as `Waiting for API key cooldown`

### Ingestion Performance

These settings are global and separate graph extraction from embedding so one stage does not slow the other down unnecessarily.

- Graph Extraction Batch Size:
  the number of extraction slots that can run at the same time
- Graph Extraction Slot Delay:
  how long that extraction slot waits after finishing before it can take another item
- Embedding Batch Size:
  the number of embedding slots that can run at the same time
- Embedding Slot Delay:
  how long that embedding slot waits after finishing before it can take another item

Important behavior:

- Batch size is parallel slots, not a wait-for-all barrier
- Slot delay starts the moment that individual slot finishes
- Each slot cools down independently

### AI Models

Graph Architect Model:

- This is the extraction model used to turn text chunks into entities and relationships
- Lighter, faster models usually work best here because ingestion can make many calls
- A Gemini Flash-class model is a good fit for most users

Chat Provider:

- `Google (Gemini)` uses the normal Gemini chat model field (uses API keys from Google AI Studio)
- `IntenseRP Next` lets you point chat at a local IntenseRP-compatible endpoint instead

IntenseRP Next:

- GitHub: [LyubomirT/intense-rp-next](https://github.com/LyubomirT/intense-rp-next)
- This path is optional
- You must enter the endpoint URL yourself
- No API key management is built into VySol for this provider path
- Extraction, entity resolution, and embeddings still follow the Gemini-side model and key flow
- Using IntenseRP Next and any provider behind it is subject to that provider's own terms of service

Chat Model:

- This is the model used to answer chat requests

Entity Chooser Model:

- This is the entity-resolution model that decides which candidate entities are actually the same entity as the current anchor entity

Entity Combiner Model:

- After the chooser selects matching entities, the combiner rewrites the merged result
- It chooses the best final display name and creates one final description from the chosen group

Default Embedding Model:

- This is the default embedding model for new worlds
- The shipped default is `gemini-embedding-2-preview`

Disable Safety Filters:

- This relaxes Gemini content moderation behavior for creative or edge-case writing workflows

## Creating A World

1. Click `Create World`.
2. Give the world a name.
3. Upload source files.

Supported source format:

- `.txt` only

For most casual use cases, the defaults are already more than enough.

## Ingestion Settings

On the world ingest page you can control:

- Chunk size
- Chunk overlap
- World embedding model
- Graph Architect glean amount

Shipped defaults:

- Chunk size: `4000`
- Chunk overlap: `150`
- World embedding model: `gemini-embedding-2-preview`
- Graph Architect glean amount: `1`

What they mean:

- Chunk Size:
  How much text goes into each chunk before ingestion splits it
- Chunk Overlap:
  How much trailing context is carried into the next chunk to solve pronoun/entity name problems
- World Embedding Model:
  The embedding model used for that world's vectors
- Graph Architect Glean Amount:
  Extra extraction passes that try to catch additional graph details after the first pass

Important save behavior:

- If you change any settings, click `Save Graph Architect Settings` before ingestion
- If you edit prompts, use each prompt's own `Save` button before ingestion
- Chunk size, chunk overlap, and world embedding model are taken from the values currently shown when you start or rebuild ingestion

## Prompt Editor

The prompt editor lets you override the shipped defaults, but the defaults are enough for most users.

Graph Architect Prompt:

- Controls how the extraction model turns text into entities and relationships
- Receives the chunk body plus any overlap as separate inputs, so overlap is reference-only context instead of part of the extractable body

Graph Architect Glean Prompt:

- Controls how later extraction passes continue after the first graph pass
- Lets you tune how the glean step uses previously extracted entities and relationships to find missed graph details

Entity Resolution Chooser Prompt:

- Controls how strictly the chooser decides whether two entities are really the same thing

Entity Resolution Combiner Prompt:

- Controls how chosen duplicate entities are merged into one final name and description

Important:

- The chooser and combiner prompts matter only when you run `Exact + chooser/combiner`
- `Exact only` does not call either model stage

## Ingestion Flow

Basic flow:

1. Add one or more `.txt` files.
2. Review the ingestion settings.
3. Save Graph Architect settings if you changed any settings.
4. Save any custom prompts if you changed them.
5. Click `Start Ingestion`.

Reading the ingest progress header:

- The main ingest header now stays stable at the world level instead of flipping between extraction and embedding worker events
- `Chunks Extracted` means chunks whose graph extraction has been durably written
- `Chunks Embedded` means chunks whose chunk vectors have been durably written
- `Unique Graph Nodes` means the current unique nodes in the saved graph
- `Embedded Unique Nodes` means how many current unique graph nodes already have embeddings in the unique-node index

Important note about node counts:

- `Unique Graph Nodes` and `Embedded Unique Nodes` reflect the current merged graph state, not raw per-chunk extraction totals
- Those counts can change after entity resolution merges duplicate entities and refreshes unique-node embeddings

Wait states during ingest:

- `Queued for extraction slot` means extraction workers are busy and this run is waiting for an extraction slot
- `Queued for embedding slot` means embedding workers are busy and this run is waiting for an embedding slot
- `Waiting for API key cooldown` means the active Gemini key pool is temporarily cooling down and the run is waiting to continue
- Short pauses in these states are normal and do not automatically mean the ingest failed

After ingestion finishes:

1. Click `Resolve Entities`.
2. Pick a run mode: `Exact only` for a fast normalized-name cleanup pass, or `Exact + chooser/combiner` for the full duplicate-resolution workflow.
3. Let entity resolution run.

If extraction hits a safety block:

- The ingest log warns you as soon as the block is detected
- A `Safety Review Queue` appears for blocked chunks
- Each review item keeps a read-only `[B#:C#]` prefix, a separate read-only overlap box when overlap exists, and one editable `Chunk Body` field
- `Test` retries that exact chunk with your edited chunk body while keeping the original source chunk untouched
- `Reset` always restores the true original source chunk, even after multiple edits or a prior successful repair
- `Discard` removes that repair item and its override state

Entity-resolution controls:

- `Resolution mode` chooses whether the run stops after exact normalized matching or continues into chooser/combiner review
- `Top K candidates` is used only for `Exact + chooser/combiner`
- `Embedding batch size` controls unique-node embedding rebuild batch size for that entity-resolution run
- `Embedding delay (seconds)` adds a per-batch cooldown to that same unique-node embedding rebuild step
- The embedding controls apply to entity resolution only; they do not change ingest or `Re-embed All`

## Rebuild And Retry Actions

Use the rebuild and retry actions based on what went wrong:

`Re-embed All`

- Clears and rebuilds chunk vectors from the previously fully ingested source set and unique-node vectors from the current saved graph state
- Ignores brand-new pending sources you added after the last clean ingest
- Is blocked if an older ingested source is missing, changed, partial, failed, or comes from an older world that never recorded source snapshots
- Uses active repaired chunk bodies when the locked source snapshot and chunk map still match
- Is blocked while this world still has unresolved safety-review work, because the rebuild would otherwise operate on incomplete repair state
- Use this when you change only the world embedding model or need to rebuild vectors without re-extracting the graph

`Re-ingest With Previous Settings`

- Fully rebuilds chunks, extraction, graph data, and vectors using the world's locked previous ingest settings
- Use this when `Re-embed All` says the prior ingested source set changed and you want a clean rebuild without adopting whatever draft chunk settings are currently in the form

`Rechunk And Re-ingest`

- Fully rebuilds chunks, extraction, graph data, and vectors using the settings currently shown in the form
- Use this when chunk settings changed on purpose or when you want a full clean rebuild with new settings

`Retry Embedding Failures`

- Retries only failed embedding work

`Retry Extraction Failures`

- Retries only failed extraction work
- Skips chunks that are still in the unresolved Safety Review Queue and points you back to that queue instead of retrying them from source text

`Retry All Failures`

- Retries both failed extraction and failed embedding work
- Also skips unresolved Safety Review Queue chunks and leaves those to the review flow

Important behavior:

- `Resume` is the normal path when you simply add another new source after a previous ingest
- When you add or remove pending sources, the ingest action area now refreshes immediately so `Resume`, `Start Over`, and completion state stay in sync without leaving the page
- `Re-embed All` is intentionally narrower than a full rebuild and will now explain when it is unsafe
- `Re-embed All` can reuse active repaired chunk bodies, but full rebuild paths still require those overrides to be discarded first
- `Retry` actions only repair failures inside the currently locked ingest; they do not apply new chunk settings
- The one-shot collapsed-chunk recovery action is only for the current world and current failed chunks; it does not teach future ingests to always treat those chunks as safety-blocked

## Chat

Open a world, create a new chat, and use the right-side retrieval settings to tune behavior.

Chat settings:

`Top K Chunks`

- How many standard chunk matches are sent into chat context

`Entry Nodes`

- How many graph entry nodes are selected before graph expansion begins
- Entry-node retrieval now ranks against one persistent vector per current graph node, not repeated chunk-local node occurrences

`Graph Hops`

- How far the graph expansion walks outward from the selected entry nodes

`Max Graph Nodes`

- A hard cap on how many graph nodes can be included
- Actual returned graph size can still be lower if the selected entry nodes simply do not reach that many unique nodes

`Vector Query (Msgs)`

- How many recent messages are used to build the retrieval search vector

`Chat History Context (Msgs)`

- How many previous chat messages are sent as chat history context

`Chat System Prompt`

- The system-level instruction that shapes how the model answers in chat
